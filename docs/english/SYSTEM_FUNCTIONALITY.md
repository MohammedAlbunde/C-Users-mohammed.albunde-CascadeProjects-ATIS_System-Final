## 1. System Tabs and Their Functions

### ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) Tab
- **Primary Function**: Generates and broadcasts airport information including weather conditions, active runways, and essential notices.
- **Key Features**:
  * Real-time METAR processing
  * Automatic message generation
  * Voice broadcast capabilities
  * Information code cycling (Alpha through Zulu)
- **Use Case**: Primary interface for controllers to manage and broadcast current airport conditions.

### AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System) Tab
- **Primary Function**: Displays raw weather data directly from airport sensors.
- **Key Features**:
  * Real-time sensor data display
  * Historical data trending
  * Sensor status monitoring
  * Calibration indicators
- **Use Case**: Used by technicians and meteorologists to monitor weather sensor data and ensure accuracy.
- **Difference from ATIS**: Shows raw sensor data rather than processed aviation messages.

### RVR (Runway Visual Range) Tab
- **Primary Function**: Monitors and reports runway visibility conditions.
- **Key Features**:
  * Runway-specific visibility measurements
  * Touchdown, midpoint, and rollout values
  * Trend monitoring
  * Minimum/maximum range alerts
- **Use Case**: Critical for low-visibility operations and CAT II/III approaches.
- **Difference**: Focuses specifically on runway visibility rather than general weather conditions.

## 2. ATIS Message Updates

### Message Change Behavior
- The message changes you observe are part of the demo mode simulation.
- In real operations, messages update based on:
  1. Significant weather changes (based on WMO criteria)
  2. Hourly scheduled updates
  3. Manual updates by controllers
  4. Changes in operational conditions (runway changes, NOTAMs)

### Real-Life Operation
- Messages typically update every hour or when significant changes occur
- Updates follow strict meteorological and operational criteria
- Each update receives a new sequential identification letter
- Controllers must manually approve changes before broadcast

## 3. Message Editing Capabilities

### Current Implementation
- The system currently operates in a structured, template-based format
- Direct text editing is intentionally limited for safety and standardization
- Controllers can modify specific fields through dropdown menus and checkboxes

### Editing Options
- Runway selection
- NOTAMs inclusion/exclusion
- Remarks addition
- Operational status updates

### Future Enhancement Possibilities
- We can implement enhanced editing capabilities:
  1. Field-specific text modification
  2. Custom remarks section
  3. Template management
  4. Phraseology alternatives
- Note: Any editing implementation must comply with ICAO and local aviation authority standards

## 4. Control Button Functions

### Record Button
- **Purpose**: Creates a new voice recording for custom messages
- **Usage**: 
  * Special announcements
  * Non-standard information
  * Custom phonetic corrections
- **When to Use**: For messages requiring non-standard phraseology or special emphasis

### Play Button
- **Purpose**: Previews the current ATIS message
- **Usage**:
  * Verify message content
  * Check voice clarity
  * Test volume levels
- **When to Use**: Before broadcasting to verify message accuracy and quality

### Update Button
- **Purpose**: Forces a manual update of weather data and message content
- **Usage**:
  * Refresh METAR data
  * Update operational information
  * Generate new message version
- **When to Use**: When immediate information updates are required

### Broadcast Button
- **Purpose**: Transmits the current ATIS message
- **Usage**:
  * Initiates radio transmission
  * Updates current information code
  * Logs broadcast time
- **When to Use**: To put new information on air or restart current broadcast

## 5. Error Detection and Validation

### Current Capabilities
The system includes multiple validation layers:

1. **METAR Validation**
   - Syntax checking
   - Value range verification
   - Missing field detection
   - Format compliance

2. **Operational Logic**
   - Runway configuration conflicts
   - Wind component analysis
   - Visibility/ceiling minimums
   - Time sequence verification

3. **Broadcast Safety**
   - Signal strength monitoring
   - Transmission integrity
   - Audio quality checks
   - System status verification

### Error Handling
- Invalid data triggers visible warnings
- Critical errors prevent broadcast
- All validation failures are logged
- Automatic failover to backup systems when necessary

## Conclusion
The ATIS Pro System is designed with multiple layers of functionality and safety features. While some limitations exist in direct message editing, these are intentional to maintain standardization and safety in aviation communications. Future enhancements can be implemented based on operational requirements while maintaining compliance with aviation standards.
